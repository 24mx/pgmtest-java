Test for prospect employees and consultants

================================================================================
1 Programming tasks - Description
================================================================================

We supply tests, but no implementations The tests are set up to catch UnsupportedOperationException so they do not fail.
It is your job to implement at least 4 of the methods in ProgrammingTasks and an implementation of ```Stack```

The code shall be implemented under 
src/main/java/com/pierceecom/pgmtest

Interfaces for the contract to implement and stubs are under this path, and shall be used for implmentation, 
Javadoc for what the methods do is provided in the code.

The tests are under
src/test/java/com/pierceecom/pgmtest
- ProgrammingTastsTest
- StackTest

The stack should implement the iterator in LIFO order

The assessment will be based on following criterias:
- Clean design
- Reuse (of code and 3rd party products)
- Maintainability
- Ability to test
- Java Knowledge Base
- Coding style

Observe that the tests supplied are just an initial set of tests, and more may be used to test your implementation.
